[![XO code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-XO-5ed9c7.svg)](https://github.com/xojs/xo)


# How it works
You need a domain with [catch-all-mailbox](https://www.google.ch/search?q=how+to+setup+catch-all+imap+mailbox) and an imap account. 

Then void-mail will automatically load all mails from the imap server. 

When the user opens the void-mail web application, he/she can read the mails corresponding to a specific address.  

# Features

* Push-Notification on new emails.
* Mail presentation are sanitized to avoid tracking. 
* In-Memory cache for very fast mail access. 
* No database required! You just need a [catch-all-mailbox](https://www.google.ch/search?q=how+to+setup+catch-all+imap+mailbox) imap server.

## TODO

Cleanup:
-   error handling everywhere (how to verify that all promises are catched, and eventEmitter have on-error?)
-   reduce code base, if possible


Features:
- better random names
- delete mails after X days.


Testing:
-   provide config for fixed data for offline testing
-   create tests

Maybe Later:
- docker deployment
- Reactive imap stream as lib
- support multiple domains
